    <h1>My Proposal</h1>
    <p>This is the official proposal.</p>
    
    <p>
      Adaptive Nemesis is a game project where the enemy AI evolves in real time to counter each player's unique weaknesses. In this project, the AI enemy continuously learns from the player's actions during gameplay, analyzing patterns such as attack style, movement, and decision-making to tailor its own strategies. The game is designed to offer every player a different and personalized experience. This ensures that no two playthroughs are ever the same. As players try to exploit predictable patterns, the AI adapts, forcing them to refine their tactics continually. The project will showcase the power of neural networks in creating dynamic, responsive opponents and illustrate how machine learning can transform traditional gaming by adding an extra layer of challenge. The educational goal is to provide insight into real-time AI learning while offering a fun and evolving challenge for players.

    <h2>What I'm Planning to Do:</h2>
    <p>
      I plan to develop a basic game framework using web technologies such as HTML5 and JavaScript. This framework will serve as the foundation for the gameplay and overall interface. I also intend to integrate a neural network that monitors player behavior and adapts enemy tactics accordingly. By doing so, the game will adjust in real-time to each player's unique approach.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Why This Project is Exciting/Fun/Educational:</h2>
    <p>
      This project delivers a unique gaming experience by ensuring that every player's challenge is tailored to their individual gameplay style. It is exciting and fun because the enemy becomes a smart, evolving adversary that responds dynamically to the player's moves. Moreover, the project is educational as it demonstrates practical machine learning applications in game design, showing how AI can transform traditional gameplay.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What Does Success Look Like:</h2>
    <p>
      Success is defined by having a functioning game prototype where the AI clearly adapts to different player behaviors. It also means providing clear documentation of the neural network's learning process and adaptation strategies.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Goals:</h2>
    <p>
      The first goal is to build the core game mechanics and interface. Another goal is to integrate real-time AI adjustments during gameplay to ensure challenges. Testing the game with multiple users to verify that unique challenges are consistently delivered is also a priority.
